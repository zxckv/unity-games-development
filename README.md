# Unity Games Development
A first-person wave shooter with minor horror elements featuring several paths of in-game progression, working together with an intertwined economy and upgrade system, all taking place over multiple maps constructed to each be thematically distinct. Inspired by games such as *Left 4 Dead*, *Sker Ritual* and *Call of Duty: Zombies*.
